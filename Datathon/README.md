# Datathon_EDA_ML
Datathon which I participated and elaborated by myself. 
In this Datathon we were requested with reading files, explore data throught visualization and statistics methods to select best features for model fitting. 
After training and selecting bets hyperparameters we had to send and .csv with our models SalePrice predictions.

Test file = test dataset (for testing purposes)
Train file = train dataset (we used this one for data clearing & wrangling)
datathon_final.ipynb = Notebook where we worked the problem solution.
